NavierStokes

NavierStokes is a set of Python classes that allow you to bridge between social network accounts. These classes rely on a number of external tools to do the hard work of actually talking to networks. There is a master “executable” file that uses the supporting classes to bridge between your various accounts. See usage information below.

It employs “fuzzy text matching”, as well as a record of posts that have already been shared between networks, to try to prevent a post from being shared more than once to other networks (or back to the originating network). Fuzzy text matching is needed because different social networks encode or format the same information slightly differently. For instance, a post in HTML on Pump.io will not be formatted in HTML on Twitter, and Twitter will shorten links, thus altering the text of the original post. Fuzzy text matching uses statistical methods to attempt to compute the probability that the message has already been shared on a network. Above a match threshold, the post will not be shared.

NavierStokes considers only posts made in the last hour when it scans the streams from different social networks. It won't re-post something that is 6 hours or 6 days old.

        git clone https://github.com/xray7224/PyPump.git
        cd PyPump
        git fetch
        git checkout v0.5
    cURL (GNU Social access)
    LYNX (for converting HTML to plain text - some social networks don't understand HTML)
    FuzzyWuzzy Python fuzzy text-matching libraries
        https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy

    t (Ruby Gem for interacting with Twitter)
        This is needed if you want to bridge to Twitter.
        http://rubygems.org/gems/t
        gem install t (requires Ruby 1.9 or greater)
    txt2html: needed for clean text → HTML conversion (e.g. from Twitter messages to Pump.io)

In general, here are the Python libraries needed to make this package operate:

abc

feedparser
fuzzywuzzy
getopt
hashlib
inspect
lockfile
logging
math
os
pycurl
pypump
re
requests
subprocess
sys
time
unicodedata
xml.dom.minidom

Installation

    Unpack the tarball. This automatically creates the navierstokes/ application directory
    You should create a configuration file for NavierStokes: ~/.navierstokes/navierstokes.cfg. The syntax for the file is explained below.
    If you intend to bridge between Pump.io and other networks, you must use PyPump to register a client (e.g. NavierStokesApp) on Pump.io. Follow their instructions for getting the client credentials and tokens. Enter those into the

    ~/.navierstokes/navierstokes.cfg

    file (see example below). PyPump docs: https://pypump.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
    Make sure Cliaspora is available in the PATH environment variable, or Diaspora interactions will fail.

Example navierstokes.cfg file

Be sure to make this .cfg file only readable by you:

    chmod 600 ~/.navierstokes/navierstokes.cfg

Note that “sharelevel” means at what level of publicity from other networks you want a notice shared to this one. I've set this, for now, the way I like it. If you set this to “Public”, ONLY notices that are public on other networks will go there. For instance, I only like to share things that are public on pump.io with Facebook and Twitter. Things on Twitter are public by default, so they will ALWAYS be shared with other networks.

“shortenurls” presently enabled will take ALL URLs listed in the message text and shorten them via ur1.ca. In the future, this will be a choice the user can make.
Running NavierStokes

"urlshortening" currently supports ur1.ca (and sites running its source) and shortenizer shortening. ur1.ca is the default shortening service/url.

Once you have written a .cfg file and setup account information in it (and, in the case of Pump.io, Twitter, and Facebook, authenticated PyPump, t, and FBCMD against those respective networks as clients), you can try executing NavierStokes manually:

    python ./NavierStokes.py

If you get errors, try running in Debug Mode and see what you can learn:

    python ./NavierStokes.py -d

I run NavierStokes every 5 minutes using a CRON job:

*/5 * * * * bash -l -c 'python /path/to/navierstokes/NavierStokes.py >> ${HOME}/.navierstokes/navierstokes.log 2>&1'

If you get any errors that are unrelated to passwords, logging into, report them to navierstokes+NOSPAM@hub.polari.us.
A simple program to authenticate PyPump against your pump.io instance

For PyPump v0.5, this ought to work:

#!/usr/bin/env python

from pypump import PyPump, Client

client = Client(
    webfinger="ME@MY.PUMP",
    type="native", # Can be "native" or "web"
    name="NavierStokesApp"
)

def simple_verifier(url):
    print 'Go to: ' + url
    return raw_input('Verifier: ') # they will get a code back

pump = PyPump(client=client, verifier_callback=simple_verifier)
client_credentials = pump.get_registration() # will return [<key>, <secret>, <expirey>]
client_tokens = pump.get_token() # [<token>, <secret>]

print "client_credentials: %s,%s" % (client_credentials[0],client_credentials[1])
print "client_tokens: %s,%s" % (client_tokens[0],client_tokens[1])
