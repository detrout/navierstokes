#NavierStokes
====================

Purpose: a system for synchronizing information between federated social networks.

##Requirements
============

* cliaspora-0.1.7.tgz (Diaspora access) (https://freeshell.de/~mk/projects/cliaspora.html)
** NOTE BENE! You must install a patch to the last release of Cliaspora! The patch
   makes it possible for Cliaspora to post text along with a file upload.
* PyPump 0.5 (pump.io access)
* cURL (GNU Social access)

##Installation
============

1) Unpack the tarball. This automatically creates the navierstokes/ application directory

2) You should create a configuration file for NavierStokes:

~/.navierstokes/navierstokes.cfg

The syntax for the file is explained below.

3) If you intend to bridge between Pump.io and other networks, you must use PyPump to 
register a client (e.g. NavierStokesApp) on Pump.io. Follow their instructions for getting 
the client credentials and tokens. Enter those into the ~/.navierstokes/navierstokes.cfg file (see example below).
PyPump docs: https://pypump.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

4) Make sure Cliaspora is available in the PATH environment variable, or Diaspora interactions
will fail.
